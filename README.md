<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GWINdPL.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="End user page"/>
</p>
<p>
Tickets can be intake through the end user portal. End users have the option to create tickets while also check the status of their previous tickets. This is where your customers will interact.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Here the end user can input their contact information, including their email address and their phone number. Along selecting a help topic that we've created before and describe the issue. They can describe the issue by providing a summary and explain further in the text box as well modify the text to their liking and upload files.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Here is the staff control panel. They can see the tickets created by our end users. In this example, we have two tickets one from the Installation created by osTicket and one from the end user Karen. (do ignore the osTicket team ticket as that comes post-install)
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
We can then visit the ticket that was created by Karen. Agents depending on their permissions can note the properties like the status of the ticket, priority along with SLA plan, who it is assigned to, who created the ticket and more. Depending on the permissions, the agent can directly modify these properties.  
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Here agents can reply to the customer and create internal notes to the backend for any clarification. They are also able to modify the text and upload files as well.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5RBt47d.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="See others changes and agents interacting with team/customer"/>
</p>
<p>
Agents working on the ticket can see changes to the ticket's properties as well as see the internal notes for the backend. It also shows history of the interaction with agents and the backend.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ARp3eM.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Ticket resolution"/>
</p>
<p>
When a ticket is finally resolved, the agent can then resolve the ticket and provide a optional update on the aftermath of the ticket.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Tickets will then be placed in the closed sub-tab of Tickets and can be viewed. (can disable viewing with permissions)
